        Using the user's preferences, recommend a list of movies that align with the user's tastes across multiple aspects. Follow these steps to create a well-rounded set of recommendations:

        1. **For the first iteration**:
        - Generate a ranked list of 50 products that align with the user's preferences across the following aspects:
        - Present the list in the following JSON format:
            {
            "recommended_items": [
                {"<parent_asin>": "<meta information>"}
                ...
            ],
            "item_new": []
            }

        2. **For subsequent iterations**:
        - Maintain a list of 20 movies by:
            - Retaining movies that have already been saved as `movies_to_save`.
            - Replacing movies specified in `movies_to_remove` with new recommendations.
        - New recommendations should align with the user's preferences based on the same aspects as described above.
        - Output the updated list of 20 movies and clearly specify the newly added movies as `movie_new` (i.e., movies that replaced those in `movies_to_remove`).
        - Ensure the output is formatted as a valid JSON object:
            {
            "recommended_movies": [
                "Movie Title 1",
                "Movie Title 2",
                ...
            ],
            "movie_new": [
                "New Movie Title 1",
                "New Movie Title 2",
                ...
            ]
            }

        3. **Important Instructions**:
        - For the first iteration, `movie_new` should be an empty list as no movies are replaced.
        - For subsequent iterations, ensure that `movie_new` includes only the new movies added in the current iteration.
        - Always return the result strictly in the specified JSON format.

        Based on the user's history reviews and the list of recommended products, generate comments for each item that reflect the user's likely thoughts and feelings. The comments should be in the user's voice and consider their preferences and personality traits.

        **When writing comments:**

        - Be honest and critical. If the user is likely to have negative or neutral feelings about certain aspects of the movie, reflect that in the comments.
        - Avoid giving unwarranted praise. Balance positive remarks with constructive criticism.
        - Consider the user's preferences and how each movie may or may not align with them.
    
        Provide the comments in the following JSON format, one per product:
        {
            "item_title": "<title>",
            "item_id": "<parent_asin>",
            "comment": "<comment>"

        You are simulating the user. Evaluate the recommended movies based on the user's preferences and the comments provided.

        **Scoring Instructions:**

        For each item, score 1 if the review is positive, score 0 if the review is neutral, score -1 if the review is negative.

        **Definition of Comments:**

        - **Positive Comment**: Expresses satisfaction, enjoyment, or appreciation.
        - **Neutral Comment**: Neither positive nor negative; shows indifference.
        - **Negative Comment**: Expresses disappointment, criticism, or dislike.

        **Example Evaluation:**

        If a movie has a comment structure like this:
        {
            "item_title": "<title>",
            "item_id": "<parent_asin>",
            "comment": "<comment>"

        - **Output only the list of evaluations in valid JSON format.**
        - **Do not include any additional text or explanations.**
        - **Ensure the JSON is properly formatted and can be parsed by `json.loads()`.**
