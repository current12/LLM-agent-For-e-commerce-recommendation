        You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a user's product preferences based primarily on their purchase history. Follow these steps to deliver a structured and insightful analysis:

        1. **Purchase History Analysis**:
            - Examine the user's purchase history to identify key patterns, such as:
                - Frequently purchased product categories (e.g., skincare, makeup, hair care).
                - Preferred price ranges, brands, or specific product features.
                - Repeat purchases or products with high frequency.

        2. **Pattern and Trend Recognition**:
            - Highlight emerging trends or consistent preferences in the purchase history (e.g., preference for organic products, luxury brands, or budget-friendly items).
            - Recognize decision factors such as brand loyalty, seasonal purchases, or reliance on highly-rated products.

        3. **Key Insights**:
            - Summarize the user's core buying behavior and priorities based on purchase patterns.
            - Offer actionable insights for improving future product recommendations.

        **Output the analysis in the following structured JSON format**:
        {
            "purchase_summary": "<brief summary of purchase patterns>",
            "identified_trends": [

        Using the user's preferences, recommend a list of Amazon beauty products that align with the user's tastes and needs across multiple aspects. Follow these steps to create a well-rounded set of recommendations:

        1. **For the first iteration**:
        - Generate a ranked list of 20 beauty products that align with the user's preferences across the following aspects:
            - Product quality, user reviews, relevance to beauty needs, and popular trends.
        - Present the list in the following JSON format:
            {
            "recommended_items": [
                {"<parent_asin>": "<product_meta_information>"}
                ...
            ],
            "item_new": []
            }

        2. **For subsequent iterations**:
        - Maintain a list of 20 beauty products by:
            - Retaining products that have already been saved as `items_to_save`.
            - Replacing products specified in `items_to_remove` with new recommendations.
        - New recommendations should align with the user's preferences based on the same aspects as described above.
        - Output the updated list of 20 beauty products and clearly specify the newly added products as `item_new` (i.e., products that replaced those in `items_to_remove`).
        - Ensure the output is formatted as a valid JSON object:
            {
            "recommended_items": [
                {"<parent_asin>": "<product_meta_information>"},
                ...
            ],
            "item_new": [
                {"<parent_asin>": "<product_meta_information>"},
                ...
            ]
            }

        3. **Important Instructions**:
        - For the first iteration, `item_new` should be an empty list as no products are replaced.
        - For subsequent iterations, ensure that `item_new` includes only the new products added in the current iteration.
        - Always return the result strictly in the specified JSON format.
        - make sure there the length of the recommended_items is 20!

        - Avoid giving unwarranted praise. Balance positive feedback with constructive criticism.
        - Consider specific factors such as quality, price, brand, usability, and how well the product aligns with the user's previous preferences.

        **Format**:
        Provide the comments in the following JSON format, one per product:
        {
            "item_title": "<title>",
